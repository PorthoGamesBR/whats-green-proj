## FAQ

#### Why you use 'Whats' instead of the name?

Lets just say that 'whats' doesn't like bots that much, and by writing that way ~i hope~ 'whats' wont find this project so easily.

#### I want to help, how can i?

Enter in contact with me by my e-mail or by GitHub itself. What this project needs the most is someone who understand the javascript used in 'Whats web', so the bot wont need to be so manual. Someone with experience with Selenium and/or HTML will be realy usefull too. And, if you realy want to help but doesn't understand a lot about any of this things, you can help with documentation (As you can see, im not that good at it). 


#### Is this project personal or will be usable to everyone?

My first intention is for it to be usable to my client, but i will try to make it as customizable as possible, since i know its hard to find a free 'whats'  bot this days.

#### Will this project be free to use?

Yes, but i do not intend it to have a friendly user interface. It's suposed to be used by programmers, and it's not just because of greed.If this project became widely used, 'whats' will probably block it somehow. I just trust programmers more than clients in not talking too much about this.

#### What if i add a friendly UI?

Well, that's on you. I can not block people from doing that, but i guarantee you that by doing this, you just cutting my and your work lifetime by a lot.
